# Hi there, I'm Alexander 👋

**Designer & Developer | Design Engineer | Creative Developer** living in the Seattle area

I'm a senior-level designer and developer with 15+ years of experience — a multidisciplinary ninja, sometimes called a creative developer or design engineer. I have a unique skill set, proficient in both design and development, with experience working full stack, but I primarily focus on creating beautiful front-end experiences.

## 🚀 What I Do

**Design:** The whole kit and kaboodle — wireframe, storyboard, prototype, user testing, full fidelity with asset creation, illustrations, photo editing, video editing, and creative direction overseeing it all.

**Develop:** Wide range of stacks, frameworks, and libraries to bring designs to life with pixel-perfect precision and smooth interactions.
